  <h2> Selecting landmark points </h2>
  <p>
  The sketch-map calculation is expensive and its expense increases sharply with the number of points whose projections you are
  endeavoring to find simultaneously. Moreover, the iterative minimization has more chances of getting stuck in a  poor local minimum
  when the number of variables to be optimized grows larger.  It is therefore not feasible to fit projections for all the points in the trajectory
  at once. Hence, before running the sketch-map algorithm we must select a set of representative, landmark, points from the trajectory.
  There are two strategies we use to do this selection:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li> Select points randomly from the trajectory - <i>with this approach there are many landmarks in the vicinity of the basins and more poorly sampled regions are less well represented </i></li>
  <li> Select points using a farthest point strategy - <i> the landmarks selected using this approach are more uniformly distributed across the whole of space which makes this approach succeptible to outliers </i></li>
  </ul> 
  
  <p>
     Both of these strategies are implemented in the <span class="code">dimlandmark</span> code. In most cases the farthest point
     sampling is the recommended strategy, as it gives a thorough representation of the available data. 
     Since it is however desirable to give more weight in the fitting to landmarks which represent densely populated regions of 
     space, <span class="code">dimlandmark</span> also allows to assign weights proportional to the density
     of samples surrounding each sample.

      The <span class="code">dimlandmark</span> utility allows to select a small, representative subset 
      of the high-dimensional data, so that dimensionality reduction can be performed more effectively.

      As for <span class="code">dimdist</span>, <span class="code">-D</span> and <span class="code">-pi</span>
      options specify the dimensionality and the periodicity of the data. <span class="code">-mode</span> 
      chooses the selection method (<span class="code">minmax</span> stands for farthest point sampling) and
      <span class="code">-w</span> asks for weights to be generated for the points. See the --MANUAL-- page 
      for a more detailed description and other options which may apply in different cases.
